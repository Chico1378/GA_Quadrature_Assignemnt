# QAP with GA üêí [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wzieba/QAP-Genetic-Algorithm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wzieba/QAP-Genetic-Algorithm) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/wzieba/QAP-Genetic-Algorithm/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/wzieba/QAP-Genetic-Algorithm)

Resolving Quadratic Assignment Problem with Genetic Algorithm

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run clone repo, go to `src` folder and run
```
python main.py
```

## üîß Config

In `config.py` you can find following configuration options:
```
CROSSOVER_PROBABILITY = 0.6
MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.08
INITIAL_POPULATION_SIZE = 1000
NUMBER_OF_GENERATIONS = 10000
DRAW_VISUALIZATION = True
```
Feel free to experiment with them.

## üìà Visualization

### Sample

### Legend (how to read)

- Red color of line means long distance, green one - short
- Thick line means big value of flow, thick one - small

Both values are in context of particular distance and flow matrices

## üöö Quadratic Assignment Problem

The objective of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is to assign n facilities to n locations in such a way as to minimize the assignment cost. The assignment cost is the sum, over all pairs, of the flow between a pair of facilities multiplied by the distance between their assigned locations.

## Genetic Algorithm

In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)

### Important note

Some fragments of this implementation were inspired by code of mgr Filip Bachura from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology
